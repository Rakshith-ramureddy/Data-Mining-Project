# Data-Mining-Project

The "Data Mining Final Business Report" involves comprehensive data analysis to extract meaningful business insights. The report covers two major tasks:

Clustering Analysis:

It starts with exploratory data analysis including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
Scaling of data for clustering is evaluated.
Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are applied to the scaled data to identify optimal clusters. Methods such as dendrograms, elbow curves, and silhouette scores are used to determine the number of clusters.
Detailed cluster profiles are created, and promotional strategies are recommended based on these clusters.
Classification Analysis:

The data is split into training and test sets.
Various classification models such as CART (Classification and Regression Trees), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks are built.
Performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curves, and AUC scores are used to evaluate these models.
The best model is identified, and business insights along with recommendations are provided based on the analysis.
This structured approach to data mining and model building enhances understanding of customer segmentation and predictive modeling, which can significantly benefit future business strategies and decision-making processes.
